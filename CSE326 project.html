<h1>AT FIRST WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO KNOW MORE THAN ONE LANGUAGE? :</h1>
<p><font size="4px" </font><i>
Here is why~<br>
We live in a multilingual world, where connections are now more important than ever. The world is becoming increasingly globalized and knowing a second language can always give you an unfair advantage.<br>

There are tangible benefits to being bilingual:<br>

*It can help you in your career;<br>
*It can improve your memory and brain functions;<br>
*It can help increase your understanding of the languages you already speak.<br>
*A second language can drastically change your career. Living in an interconnected world means that more and more jobs are advertising positions where knowing more than one language is essential. <br>
<br>
*As more companies trade internationally and create relationships with other countries, employees are often asked to travel for work, enhance these relationships, or be relocated abroad. <br>
<br>
*Besides having more chances of landing a good job or advancing in your career, learning a second language can also give you an insight into other cultures. You will be more prepared and confident to travel the world and explore other people’s ways of living.<br>
<br>
*Lack of integration is a real problem for most countries. More often than not, this is due to the language barrier. People outside of their home countries end up being isolated, hanging out only with people from similar communities where their language is spoken. <br>
<br>
*Learning a second language opens up the opportunity for being part of a community with a different culture, and learning more about the world around us. <br>
<br>
*Did you know that being bilingual can also help you master your own language? For example, learning a new language with similar roots can help you learn other languages as well. Take <q>Spanish, Italian, and French</q> together!

<P><strong>1.Get real:</strong><mark> Decide on a simple, attainable goal to start with so that you don’t feel overwhelmed. “Pick up 50 words of a language and start using them on people — and then slowly start picking up grammar.”</mark><br>
<br><br>

<strong>2.Aim for the Brain Melt:</strong>
<mark>You know how when you do a lot of intellectually intensive work for hours and hours on end, at some point your brain just feels like a lump of gravy?<br>
Shoot for that moment when learning foreign languages. Until you’ve reached brain-gravy stage, you probably aren’t maximizing your time or effort.<br>
In the beginning, you’ll hit mind-melt within an hour or two. Later on, it may take an entire night of hanging out with locals before it happens. But when it happens, it’s a very good thing.</mark></strong.<br>

<strong>3.Play house with the language:</strong> <mark>The more you invite a foreign language into your daily life, the more your brain will consider it something useful and worth caring about. “Use every opportunity to get exposed to the new language”</mark><br>
<br><br><br>

<strong>4.Phrase Books and dictionaries:</strong><mark>
Phrase books can be useful for the odd sticky situation or emergency when you need to whip your book out and know how to communicate something, but unless you want to go around with a book in front of your face reciting sentences parrot fashion, phrase books can only take you so far. Phrase books are great for learning simple greetings, numbers and knowing simple tourist phrases, but to develop your knowledge further you will need to know how to structure sentences and learn about grammar.<br>
This is where grammar books come in so that you can learn tenses and the rules for forming sentences. Dictionaries are also useful if you need to look up a word you don’t know or if you want to expand your vocabulary

<strong>5.music:</strong>
<mark>Everyone loves music because it’s fun and having fun is important when you’re trying to learn a language. Songs are catchy and easy to listen to, so try downloading or buying music in a foreign language. Repetition is the key to learning, so if you listen to the same song over and over again you will eventually know the words.
It’s a great way to learn about the popular or traditional music styles in that country too. If you have a favourite popular song try to find it sung in another language or find the lyrics on the internet and sit there with them whilst you listen to the song.</mark><br>

<strong>6.find a foreign friend:</strong>
<mark>When you’re backpacking you’re bound to meet a variety of people from different countries in your hostel, …so take advantage of this great opportunity to learn a foreign language and ask them how to say things in their lingo!<br>

Have fun with it, one of the first things people always ask is how to say rude words or swear words in another language.Foreign people won’t mind if you ask them how to say something in their language, in fact they’ll be flattered that you’re keen to make the effort to learn.</mark><br>

<strong>7.Do not worry about making mistakes: </strong> <mark>One of the most common barriers to conversing in a new language is the fear of making mistakes. But native speakers are like doting parents: any attempt from you to communicate in their language is objective proof that you are a gifted genius. They’ll appreciate your effort and even help you. Nervous about holding a conversation with a peer? Try testing your language skills with someone a little younger.</mark><br>
