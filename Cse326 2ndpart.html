"" LANGUAGE - FRENCH ""<br>
<b>1. Review – Repetition Is The Key!<b><br>
This is probably the number one mistake students make.

They concentrate on learning new material, and forget to review the older one.<br><br>
2. Study French Regularly, For A Short Time, Not All In One Sitting<br>
If you study French all afternoon,  chances are that you’ll exhaust yourself, and are much more likely to get frustrated, lose your motivation or attention.

Spending 15-30 minutes a day learning French – not multitasking but with 100% of your attention – will get you better results than two hours during the weekend with the kids playing in the background.<br><br>
3. Learn French In Sentences<br>
When you learn French “in context”, you’ll remember the situation and words longer, and you’ll already have a series of words that go well together handy for your next French conversation!

To learn French in context, I highly recommend you check out my unique downloadable French audiobooks, a unique French learning method illustrated by a realistic bilingual novel recorded at different levels of enunciation, featuring both traditional and modern spoken French pronunciation.<br><br>
4. Avoid Writing In Your Head<br>
Many students “write” French in their head before they speak.

However in French, may letters are silent, like the “ent” of the “ils” form, or the é sound at the end of a verb: parler, parlez, parlé, parlée, parlés, parlées.

Writing in your head a huge waste of time and may lead to being scared to speak French.<br><br>
5. Translate French Into English As Little As Possible<br>
When you are a total beginner, some translation is going to occur. As you advance in your French studies, try as much as possible to avoid translating.

Translating adds a huge step in the process of speaking:<br>

Idea –> English –> French<br>
versus just<br>
idea –>French<br>

It makes your brain waste 30% more time and energy and will fool you into making a mistake when the literal translation doesn’t work – which is unfortunately often the case in French!

   "" LANGUAGE - SPANISH""<br>
1. Listen to the radio in Spanish:<br>
Listening to the radio in Spanish is something you’ll find enjoyable after about two years of being fairly fluent. I found it impossible at first, but I recommend sticking with it. Understanding what someone says in a foreign language without seeing their lips can be tricky.

I managed to fit in a good hour and a half every day, listening to the radio on my phone when traveling to and from work in Buenos Aires.

It was a great way of making the journey go faster, it gave me loads of stuff to talk about with my Argentine friends, plus it got me hooked on some awesome Spanish-speaking musicians. In particular, Andrés Calamaro, Vicentico, Joaquín Sabina, Anita Tijoux, Calle 13 and Gustavo Cordera.

At home, I always leave the radio on in the background and even after seven years in Latin America I still hear phrases that I don’t understand. I note them down and look them up later. The learning process with the radio really doesn’t ever stop.<br><br>
2. Travel to Spanish-speaking countries:<br>
learn spanish

Travel, travel and keep on traveling. I spent around seven years traveling to Spanish-speaking countries before I made the move to Venezuela and it gave me lots of confidence. I got better at sharing with locals and recognizing through context what they were trying to say to me. It was always a real buzz and kept me wanting to improve my language skills.

Also, it’s important to travel to a variety of countries to hear different accents and different kinds of Spanish.

Before moving to Venezuela, I’d already visited Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Belize and Spain. Since living in Latin America, I’ve made time to travel to Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia and Mexico.

The more Spanish you hear, the easier it becomes for you to understand it in any context.<br><br>
3. Spend time in Spanish-speaking environments:<br>
If you can’t travel abroad, travel to places in your hometown where Spanish-speaking people hang out. Before leaving London, I used to go to a lot of salsa clubs, and I remember having a really great time.

I’d also eat in Spanish restaurants, drink in Spanish cocktail bars and I even joined a Spanish conversation group at one point. It was a group organized by native Spanish speakers as a way of bridging the cultural gap between Londoners and foreigners who were living a long way from home.

That particular group doesn’t exist anymore—I’ve checked—but there must be plenty of others.

Another great strategy is to transform your home into a Spanish learning hotspot! In fact, to learn Spanish, one of the ultimate strategies is to change your environment into a place that promotes Spanish learning and education. And the best part? This can be achieved whether you live in a Spanish-speaking country or not!<br><br>
4. Take some online Spanish courses:<br>
learn spanish

A highly effective method for learning Spanish on your own is to take some online Spanish courses. Let’s face it; we pretty much travel with our laptops, tablets and phones at all times—which means that any online course will be at your disposal anytime, anywhere.

What’s not to love about that?

Keep in mind that you’re more likely to devote time to a program that holds your interest. For me, I enjoyed from time to time using Coffee Break Spanish and Fluencia. They both incorporate Spanish culture into their lessons, which really helps spice things up—at least it did for me!

how to learn spanish by yourselfCoffee Break Spanish has several options for Spanish courses. Their Coffee Break Academy offers courses ranging from beginner level to intermediate. There’s even a “master” course to help push you to toward total fluency.

The Coffee Break Spanish Reading Club is a fantastic way to build vocabulary skills. The focus of this course is to use weekly texts to introduce cultural insights while building reading skills.

how to learn spanish by yourselfFluencia is another excellent course for Spanish language learners to consider using. This site is heavy on cultural information, so if you’re looking to learn more than just the mechanics of the Spanish language, this course is for you.

Lessons use native speakers and are broken up into topics that make for an organized, efficient method for learning. Lessons include conversations—perfect for pronunciation practice!—as well as vocabulary and cultural segments.<br><br>
5. Keep a Spanish blog:<br>
learn spanish

The idea of keeping a Spanish blog is something I’ve only been considering for the past couple of months, but I think it’s something anyone can do, even as a Spanish-speaking beginner.

The idea is to create a free, basic blog (Blogger and WordPress both have great platforms for this) and begin by adding an editor’s note explaining that you’ve set up this blog to help you improve your Spanish writing skills and to document your progress.

You should then commit to writing one post a week, or once every fortnight, but—and here’s the key—make sure you write it in English first and then translate it into Spanish before you publish.

By writing each post in English, you won’t restrict yourself to the Spanish vocabulary you already know. You’ll benefit from the freedom of your native language, and then have the tricky task of turning the post into Spanish.

I have no doubt that this exercise will help to broaden vocabulary, test grammatical knowledge and build confidence when it comes to writing in Spanish.<br><br>
